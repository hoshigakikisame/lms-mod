# Polinema LMS Mod
## Background
Me myself is Polinema's student and I found that the LMS is not user friendly. It's pain in the a** to find the assignments and courses and it doesn't really show you all the upcoming assignments. So I decided to make a Tampermonkey script to make it easier for me to access the assignments and courses.

## About
Tampermonkey script that adds mod menu to Polinema LMS
The idea behind this script is to make it easier for students to access their assignments and courses. This script is not intended to be used for cheating or any other malicious activities. The script is open source and can be modified by anyone. The script is not affiliated with Polinema or any other institution. The script is not responsible for any damage caused by the script. Use the script at your own risk.

## Features
- [x] Floating mod menu.
- [x] Shortcut menu for all upcoming assignment including the unlisted ones.
- [x] Shortcut menu for all user courses.
- [x] Font Enhancher. Change the font of the LMS to "that" font.
- [x] (Experimental) Authentication using Polinema's SSO. So you don't need to go to siakad > slc > lmsslc to access the LMS.
- [x] (Experimental) Extend cookie expiration time.
